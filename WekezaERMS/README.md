## Risk Matrix (5x5)

### Likelihood Scale
1. **Rare** - May occur only in exceptional circumstances (< 5% probability)
2. **Unlikely** - Could occur at some time (5-25% probability)
3. **Possible** - Might occur at some time (25-50% probability)
4. **Likely** - Will probably occur in most circumstances (50-75% probability)
5. **Almost Certain** - Expected to occur in most circumstances (> 75% probability)

### Impact Scale
1. **Insignificant** - Minimal financial impact (< $10K), no regulatory concern
2. **Minor** - Small financial impact ($10K-$100K), minor regulatory concern
3. **Moderate** - Moderate financial impact ($100K-$1M), some regulatory concern
4. **Major** - Significant financial impact ($1M-$10M), major regulatory concern
5. **Catastrophic** - Severe financial impact (> $10M), severe regulatory/reputational damage

### Risk Levels (Calculated from Matrix)
- **Low Risk** (Score 1-4): Accept with monitoring
- **Medium Risk** (Score 5-9): Accept with enhanced controls
- **High Risk** (Score 10-15): Mitigate with action plans
- **Very High Risk** (Score 16-20): Immediate action required
- **Critical Risk** (Score 21-25): Escalate to Board/Executive
